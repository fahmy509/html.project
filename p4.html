CAD refers to software package, which could be a creative design process that's done employing a ADP system. Its software, the CAD design program, is widely employed by professionals within the design field that needs much precise technical drawings. However, it's not like other drawing programs where you'll simply open and start drawing. It requires a mix of tools and mathematical equations to induce started, and so as to induce the planning precise. because it isn't easy to master the program, people are trained to become professionals so as to use the program.
Advantages of CAD:

1. Saves time: once you are using the software package software, it'll save some time and you'll make better and more efficient designs in shorter time duration.

2. Easy to edit: once you are making designs, you'll find the requirement to form alterations. once you are using software package software, it'll be much easier to form any changes because you'll fix the errors and modify the drawings easily.

3. Decrease in error percentage: because the CAD software makes use of a number of the simplest tools, the proportion of error that occurred thanks to manual designing is significantly reduced.

4. Decrease design effort: When it involves the quantity of effort that was needed for the sake of designing the various models, it's been reduced significantly because the software automates most of the task.

5. Code re-use: because the entire task is applied with the assistance of computer tools, it removes the matter of duplication of labor, you'll copy the various parts of code and style which may then be reused multiple times over and once more.

6. Easy to share: The CAD tools make it easier to save lots of the files and store it during a way that you simply can use it time and again and send it with none unwanted hassles too.

7. Improved accuracy: there's absolutely little question about the very fact that the sort of accuracy that CAD software will offer can never be achieved by choosing manual drawings. you've got tools to live the precision, skill and accuracy level of the designs.
Disadvantages of CAD:

Work is lost thanks to the sudden breakdown of computers
Work is susceptible to viruses
Work may be easily “hacked”
Time taking process to grasp a way to operate or run the software
High production or purchasing cost for brand new systems
Time and price of coaching the staff which can work thereon
Need of normal updating of software or operating systems
Needs less employment thanks to CAD/CAM systems
As a results of other areas of technology, we are able to expect that CAD will still develop within the future, opening up new and innovative methods of design and engineering for variety of various industries. this may aid in making users experiences of CAD equipment more intuitive and straightforward than they ever thought possible.
