Introduction to computer systems architecture and
programming could be a ‘100’ course offered on the Economics, Management,
Finance and therefore the Social Sciences (EMFSS) suite of programmes.
The computer has become an integral a part of our lives. except for the
computer you employ to write down your coursework and to speak with
friends, there's the pc technology embedded in your kitchen appliance
that detects how hot to brew your coffee, in your mobile telephone, in the
ticket reader that deducts your carfare directly from your bus pass, in the
ATM (automatic teller machine) that disposes your money for the week, etc.
The list is large and is getting longer day by day.
However, most of the users of those technologies have little or no
knowledge of the history of this phenomenal development and tiny
understanding of how a computer works. For most, the pc remains a
black box that magically runs software applications. during this course you'll
learn how a computer’s architecture provides for the pc services we
have become so familiar with using.
Also, those of you who are studying for the BSc Information systems
and management are aware that the systems you're studying rely
heavily on technology, and a few insight into this technology is
vital, especially if your future career requires you to manage information
system development projects that involve the assembly of software.
This course provides you with an insight into how computers operate. It
will try this from two perspectives. it'll first explore the realm of computer
architecture (which means it'll study the underlying components of a
computer and therefore the way they do processes and instructions). it'll also
look at the ways computers can interact with one another in an exceedingly network.
Once you're at home with the essential way a computer operates, you will
learn how you'll be able to use programming code to instruct a computer (in other
words, how you'll be able to write your own software). you'll be introduced to the
fundamental concepts of programming using Java as an example.
In brief, this course won't only equip you with the abilities to develop basic
Java applications, it'll also introduce you to the areas of technology
that are essential for you to know the inner processing during
program execution
